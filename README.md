# Almanac

Event-driven workflows for one operator's software projects, deterministic up to the point of inference.

An almanac is a self-contained binary. It receives events, deduplicates and correlates them, gathers facts through recorded calls, applies a pure policy, and produces a small closed set of effects. Agents are brought in only for work that needs judgment or repair, and the compiler keeps text an attacker could have written out of their instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> Early. `almanacs/renovate` runs live, repairing real Renovate pull requests, and it is days old. Read [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) for why this exists.

## A workflow

```rust
#[workflow(
    on = PullRequestOpened,
    key = "{repo}:{head_branch}",
    intent = "Report whether a dependency update is safe.",
    may = [Attest, Await, File, Ask],
    runs_per_hour = 10,
    subjects = [repo(repo)],
    decide = policy,
)]
pub async fn dependency_updates(cx: &Cx, pr: &PullRequestOpened) -> Result<Facts, Halt> {
    let registry = cx.get::<dyn Registry>()?;
    let evidence = cx.observe("registry", registry.evidence(pr)).await?;
    let prompt = ReviewerPrompt { repo: pr.repo.clone() };
    let review = cx.agent(REVIEWER).read(prompt, &evidence).await?;
    Ok(Facts { evidence, review })
}
```

`gather` does I/O and inference through `Cx`, so everything is recorded. `policy` is a plain function of the facts, so it is table-testable and re-runs on replay. The macro finds the agents and providers in the body, puts them in the manifest, and checks them at startup.

## Try it

```bash
mise install
make check
cd almanacs/renovate
cargo run -- synth
cargo run -- explain almanac::config::secret
```

`make check` needs podman and the `claude` CLI. It calls no model and needs no credentials. `synth` prints what an almanac may do, and `explain` gives the long form of any error.

To start your own:

```bash
cargo build --release --package almanac-cli
target/release/almanac new my-almanac
cd my-almanac
../target/release/almanac generate workflow watch-things
```
